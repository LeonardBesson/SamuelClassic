Samuel
======

Slam/swing timer

Static swing timer with 1 - 1.5 second Slam marker for warriors.
I intend to make the thing customisable eventually but right now it's a static 200px wide 5px high bar.
It indicates the next expected swing to happen using a white bar that fills up a darker background.
