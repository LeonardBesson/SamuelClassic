This is a port of the original Vanilla addon Samuel for Classic WoW 1.13.
All credit goes to the original author: https://github.com/Terrub/Samuel

As I currently do not have access to the beta, I will not be able to fix bugs in the near future.
Feel free to open an issue and I will take a look at it as soon as I get access.

Samuel
======

Slam/swing timer

Static swing timer with 1 - 1.5 second Slam marker for warriors.
I intend to make the thing customisable eventually but right now it's a static 200px wide 16px high bar.
It indicates the next expected swing to happen using a white bar that fills up a darker background.

-- SLASH COMMANDS --
for options type /sam or /samuel

-- INSTALLATION --
